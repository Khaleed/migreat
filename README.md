## Motivation

Immigration has been an important phenomena over the past few centuries and has recently come to the forefront with the recent refugee crisis in Europe. This is an experiment to visualise the most recent global immmigration wave from 1990 to 2013 using d3 and react.

## Methodology

The data is consumed using a Python script with pandas and numpy data analysis libraries. The map of the world is drawn using d3 and topoJSON data. The centre of each country is identified on the map using d3 centroid function. Migration flow animation using HTML5 canvas complete the data visualisation. The code is written following functional programming principles using the lodash immutable data structures library. The first part of this project is to visualise U.S. immigration data for the top 20 country of origins. The project is a work in progress.
